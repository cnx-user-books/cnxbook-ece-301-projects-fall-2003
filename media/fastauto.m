% Implements a pitch detector using a fast-autocorrelation algorithm.
%
% Returns P, a vector of frequencies corresponding to each point in time
% and W, a vector of frequencies corresponding to each window
%
% Takes s, the monaural signal; winsize, the length of the window; jump, the
% distance between the left edge of a window and the left edge of the next
% window; and corrthresh the correlation detection threshold.
%
% Advisory: let winsize = 1000 and jump = 500, corrthresh should be no
% greater than 0.075 for optimal results.
